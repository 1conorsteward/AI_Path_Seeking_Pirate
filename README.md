The project involves implementing a deep Q-learning agent for a treasure hunt game where a pirate tries to find the treasure before the player does.

The provided code includes:
Pre-built Classes:
TreasureMaze.py: Represents the maze environment as an 8x8 matrix.
GameExperience.py: Manages game episodes, including states for learning.
Starter Code:
Importing necessary libraries (Keras, NumPy, etc.).
A predefined maze layout and functions for visualization.

My work involved completing the implementation of the deep Q-learning algorithm for the pirate. This included filling in the #TODO sections to:
Build and train a neural network using Keras.
Implement the agent's exploration and exploitation strategies.
Integrate these components to allow the pirate to learn an optimal path to the treasure over successive episodes.
Connecting Learning to Computer Science:
This project demonstrates fundamental computer science concepts, particularly in artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning. Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing algorithms and systems that can learn and adapt over time. The work showcases how AI can optimize decision-making in complex environments, a skill that is highly relevant across industries, from robotics to healthcare.

Approaching problems as a computer scientist involves breaking down tasks into smaller components, iterating on solutions, and using analytical thinking. This project required understanding the theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning and translating them into code. By doing so, I learned how to evaluate trade-offs between exploration (learning new strategies) and exploitation (leveraging known strategies), a critical aspect of AI development.

Ethical Responsibilities
As a computer scientist, ethical responsibilities include ensuring transparency, fairness, and security in AI systems. For this project, ethical considerations might involve preventing unintended biases in how the AI agent navigates the maze or ensuring that the system behaves predictably in different scenarios. In broader applications, the ethical handling of data, avoiding harm, and maintaining user trust are paramount for both end users and the organizations deploying these systems.
